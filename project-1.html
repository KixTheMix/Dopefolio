                The Shoe puts the player in quite the situation. You're drunk at a houseparty in the middle of the
                winter and as you leave you realize one small detail... someone has stolen your other <strong>Matsune 
                Hiku</strong> shoe! But as you search the house and to confront the thief you realize that your 
                perception of the world has been twisted.
              </p>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                This game was a passion project by me and my significant other, I was the <b>Writer/Narrative 
                Designer</b> while he was the <b>Game Designer/Artist/Programmer</b>. We wanted to make a fun and short 
                game, and the idea stayed an idea until the summer of 2025 when it began development. We finished the 
                game in January 2026 after putting it on the back-burner since September 2025.
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Writing</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The challenge I set for myself was to make something anxiety inducing into something comedic. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>The Goals</strong>
                <br>
                  - I wanted the story to be <b>immersive</b> to the player where the added visual element would only 
                    <b>enhance</b> it.
                <br>
                  - There needed to be <b>sillyness</b> sprinkled throughout the story as it wasn't supposed to be 
                  serious. 
                <br>
                  - The feeling of being <b>drunk</b> was essential to the story and would tie in with the comedy. It 
                    would also further the immersion for the player. It would also act as a struggle for the player as 
                    the character would be unable to see faces.
                <br>
                  - A <b>hook</b> was needed to interest and engage the player in the start, but the player also had to 
                 be <b>motivated</b> to follow the character throughout the whole game.
                <br>
                <br>
                <strong>Immersion</strong>
                <br>
                - The Shoe was the main problem in the story and acted as hook. 
                <br>
                - The character you play has is a couple of drinks into the night, and it needed to present and obvious
                 to the player without the game telling them that. It needed to be conveyed through the game and not 
                simply through text.  
                <br>
                - The internal dialogue included both descriptions of the characters environment and the characters 
                feelings and perception of everything. Comments and remarks about the things transpiring around the 
                player. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Visual impairment</b>
                <br>
                - The faces of all characters within the games are blurry and is the main reason behind that was to 
                make it harder for the player to identify the thief. They instead have to rely on other physical 
                descriptions given by other characters.
                <br>
                - Characters stand out visually from each other and this is done through graphics and 
                physical descriptions through both internal thoughts and conversation. 
                <br>
                - All environmental descriptions are also described but follow the same format. They're filled with 
                comments from the drunk player and a general feeling of disconnect.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Characters</b>
                <br>
                - All the characters have different personalities that affect how they interact with the player, giving 
                both a more interesting experience and a feeling of believability into the world. 
                <br>
                - The characters goal is also to help the player by giving them clues about the thief and the reality 
                around them.
                <br>
                - Some characters are more helpful towards the player while some act to fill out the world and exist 
                in the background or included in an activity. As the game is set in a houseparty filled with people, 
                it was important to make sure it did not feel empty. 
                <br>

              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Player choices</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                As usual in Visual Novels, the player has the agency to make their own choices to influence the story 
                as well as to create their own path and order of things. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Narrative Choices</b>
                <br>
                - The player always has a choice of how to approach a new character or how to respond to them. 
                <br>
                - The purpose if to give the player a sense of control and immersion with the world and the character 
                they inhabit. But they have no real effect on the gameplay itself. 
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Gameplay Choices</b>
                <br>
                - The player can control how much more or less drunk the character is throughout the game. 
                <br>
                - This is done through situations where the player can choose to drink more alcohol, or take it easy 
                and sober up. This is shown through the wobbly effect on the screen and it's severity. 
              </p>
              <h3 class="project-details__content-title">Level Design</h3>
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Even though the game was in a 2d world, some level design had to be made to counteract a disconnect 
                between the gameworld and the player.
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The rooms</b>
                <br>
                - The placements of the room was to mimic a normal house layout. 
                <br>
                - The lower floor contained the most people and interactions with other characters. This is also where 
                the clues of the thief are found. 
                <br>
                - The upper floors were meant to be more calm and give more introspection for the character you play as. 
                More environmental interactions reside here and slow the pace down, to give the character time to 
                breathe. 
                <br>
                - At first the player needed to visit all the rooms to progress but this was removed due to lack of 
                reason and motivation. 
                <br>
                - The <b>purpose</b> of the rooms were to further immerse the player. But also to diversify the 
                experience with different interactions and paces.
                <br>
                <br>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                The first playtest was focused on the writing and narrative.
